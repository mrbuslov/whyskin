# whyskin
WhySkin is an online Korean cosmetics store that I developed for me and my girlfriend. So far, this project does not have any supernatural technologies, because I made it as an MVP - for a quick launch.
This project is ready to be deployed on the server. Missing Gunicorn and Nginx configuration (if you need help in compiling, feel free to ask).
